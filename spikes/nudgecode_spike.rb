# this will be the "native" code for the Nudge2 language interpreter:

# here's a program, with the four point types shown (block, literal, erc, instruction, binding):

block
  literal :int, -133
  instr :int_add
  block
    erc :bool, false
    instr :int_sub
    instr :bool_and
    instr :code_quote
    binding 'x1'
    literal :int, 800
    instr :code_quote
    block
      instr :int_neg
      instr :int_dup
      block
      block
        instr :bool_xor
  erc :bool, true
  instr :code_if

# here's a "flat" multiline program in Nudge2

block
  instr :exec_dup
  erc :int, 4
  instr :int_rand
  instr :int_dup
  instr :int_shove
  literal :int, -99

# and here's a one-line program (without an initial block):

literal :int, 66




# This suggests representations for other interpreters, too
# here's one for Koza-style S-expressions:

arity2 :add
  arity2 :subtract
    arity1 :negative
      binding 'x'
    arity2 :add
      erc :int, 12
      arity2 :multiply
        erc :float, 9.12
        binding 'y'
  erc :float, -18.91
# (-x - ( 12 + 9.12 * y ) ) + -18.91
# the syntax check is: every arityX line must have X lines at the next-higher indent


#here's a more complex example, just to explore more:

arity2 :multiply
  arity2 :multiply
    arity2 :multiply
      binding 'profit'
      arity2 :add
        erc :int, 12
        binding 'drawdown'
    binding 'profit'
  arity4 :if_LTE
    binding 'volatility'
    erc :int, 8100
    arity2 :add
      binding 'profit'
      binding 'drawdown'
    arity2 :multiply
      erc :proportion, 0.71
      erc :int, 100
#  (profit * (12 + drawdown)) * profit * \
#  (IF volatility â‰¤ 8100 THEN (profit + drawdown) ELSE (0.71 * 100))


# how far can this go? How about a linear GP interpreter?
# based on Langdon & Banzhaf, GECCO 2004 "Repeated Sequences in Liner GP Genomes"
# there are 8 registers r0-r7, initialized to input values
# each instruction has
#  a register to write the result,
#  a register as 1st operand,
#  an opcode, and
#  a register or integer in [0,127]
# result is found in r0 at the end of serial execution


into r0
  arity2 :add
    register r0
    register r1
into r3
  arity2 :multiply
    register r0
    literal 3
into r2
  arity2 :subtract
    register r1
    erc :int, 71
into r1
  arity2 :subtract
    register r0
    register r3
into r0
  arity2 :add
    register r3
    register r2


# And how about a DataPageant interpreter version?
# each node has
#  an opcode
#  a set of input ports for arguments,
#    referenced by absolute or relative order in program [modulo length]
