Feature: Wtf trace
  In order to follow what's happening in a complex Nudge program
  As a modeler
  I want to be able to see the output of instructions as strings, not just results

  
  Scenario: an executable should have a toggle parameter to run in wtf mode
    Given context
    When event
    Then outcome
